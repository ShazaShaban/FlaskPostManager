The database URI that you define in your Flask application is the string that SQLAlchemy uses to connect to your database. The format of the URI depends on the type of database that you are using.

For example, to connect to a PostgreSQL database, you would use the following URI:

postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/my_database
To connect to a MySQL database, you would use the following URI:

mysql://username:password@localhost:3306/my_database
To connect to a SQLite database, you would use the following URI:

sqlite:///my_database.sqlite3
You can define the database URI in your Flask application by setting the SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI configuration variable. You can do this in the create_app() function or in the configuration file.

For example, to define the database URI in the create_app() function, you would add the following code:

Python
from flask import Flask

def create_app():
    app = Flask(__name__)

    app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/my_database'

    return app

To define the database URI in the configuration file, you would add the following line to the configuration file:

SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/my_database
Once you have defined the database URI, you can use SQLAlchemy to interact with your database. For example, you can create database tables, insert data into database tables, and query data from database tables.

Here is an example of how to use SQLAlchemy to insert data into a database table:

Python
from flask import Flask
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/my_database'
db = SQLAlchemy(app)

class User(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = db.Column(db.String(100))

user = User(name='John Doe')
db.session.add(user)
db.session.commit()
Use code with caution. Learn more
This code will create a new user in the database with the name "John Doe".

You can learn more about using SQLAlchemy with Flask in the Flask-SQLAlchemy documentation: https://flask-sqlalchemy.palletsprojects.com/.

SQLite is a lightweight, embedded, relational database management system (RDBMS) that is widely used in mobile devices, web applications, and embedded systems. It is self-contained, meaning that it does not require a separate database server process. SQLite databases are also very compact, making them ideal for use in applications where space is limited.



Psycopg2 is a Python database adapter that allows Python programs to access PostgreSQL databases. It is necessary to install psycopg2 to run PostgreSQL in Python because it provides the Python code with the ability to communicate with the PostgreSQL database server.

Psycopg2 provides a number of features that make it the most popular Python database adapter for PostgreSQL, including:

Performance: Psycopg2 is very fast and efficient, making it ideal for use in high-performance applications.
Features: Psycopg2 supports all of the features of PostgreSQL, including transactions, prepared statements, and cursors.
Reliability: Psycopg2 is a mature and well-tested database adapter that has been used in production for many years.
Ease of use: Psycopg2 is very easy to use and there are many resources available to help developers get started.
If you are developing a Python application that needs to access a PostgreSQL database, then you need to install Psycopg2.

Here are some examples of how Psycopg2 can be used to interact with a PostgreSQL database:

Connecting to a PostgreSQL database:
Python
import psycopg2

conn = psycopg2.connect(database="my_database", user="my_user", password="my_password")
